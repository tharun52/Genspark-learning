Objective:
Build a Weather Dashboard that fetches real-time weather data using an open API (like OpenWeatherMap) and displays it using Angular components. Use RxJS Observables, async pipe, and HTTPClient to handle API calls and data flow.
⸻
Requirements
1. Setup & Structure
• Use Angular 17 or later.
• Create at least the following components:
• WeatherDashboardComponent
• CitySearchComponent
• WeatherCardComponent
• Create a service: WeatherService that uses HttpClient.
⸻
2. Functional Requirements
Search City Weather
• The user enters a city name in a search box.
• On clicking “Search”, fetch current weather data from OpenWeatherMap API (or use dummy/mock JSON if needed).
• Display temperature, weather condition (cloudy, sunny, etc.), humidity, wind speed.
Live Data Stream Using Observable
• Use RxJS Observables to handle:
• API response stream.
• Component interaction (i.e., use a BehaviorSubject in WeatherService to communicate between CitySearchComponent and WeatherDashboardComponent).
• Optional: A timer (interval()) to refresh the weather data every 5 minutes.
Error Handling
• Show a user-friendly error message when:
• City not found
• API error occurs
⸻
UI Expectations
• Simple and clean layout using Angular Material (optional).
• Weather Card:
• City Name
• Weather Icon
• Temperature
• Conditions (e.g., Clear Sky)
• Humidity
• Wind Speed
⸻
Optional if Time Permits
• Add a history section showing last 5 searched cities.
• Store history in localStorage and show clickable buttons to re-fetch weather.
• Use ReplaySubject to maintain the search history observable.
